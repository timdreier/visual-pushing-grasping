# Visual Pushing and Grasping Toolbox
This is a fork of [Visual Pushing and Grasping Toolbox](https://github.com/andyzeng/visual-pushing-grasping)
I used in my university project for AI-based gripping point determination.

## Installation

To run the project you have to install [b5](https://github.com/team23/b5)
and [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with NVIDIA GPU support,
[nvidia-docker](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/install-guide.html#docker).

Afterwards, you can set up and execute the project with the following two commands:

```shell
# Setup project
b5 install

# Run project
b5 run
```

This should open vrep with the default scene.

## Commands
The following commands are available in the project. Navigate to the location of this repo in your shell and run the commands there.
